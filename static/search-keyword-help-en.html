    <div class="search-keyword-help">
        Refine the search with the following control characters:<br /><br />
        <span class="search-keyword-help-character">*</span> as a wildcard for any text<br />
        Example: <span class="search-keyword-help-character">Vadian*</span><br /><br />
        <span class="search-keyword-help-character">~</span> to specify fuzziness / distance that will be considered in the search<br />
        Example: <span class="search-keyword-help-character">arbeit~1</span> will also find letters with the terms <i>arbeyt</i> or <i>arbait</i><br /><br />

        The character <span class="search-keyword-help-character">~</span> can also be used to search for words within a certain distance of each other.<br />
        Example: <span class="search-keyword-help-character">"Zwingli Haller"~5</span> finds letters containing passages where there are no more than five words between Zwingli and Haller.
