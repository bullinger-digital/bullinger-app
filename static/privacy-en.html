                <div>
                    Data protection serves to protect personal rights. It obliges data processors to act lawfully and
                    grants affected persons enforceable rights concerning the processing of their personal data.
                    Personal data, as defined by § 3 of the Information and Data Protection Act of the Canton of Zurich
                    (IDG ZH), includes all information relating to an identified or identifiable person. This includes
                    details such as name, address, telephone number, email address, or IP address.
