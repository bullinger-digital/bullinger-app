                        The starting point for <i>Bullinger Digital</i> was the information on the Bullinger correspondence provided by the <i>Institute for Swiss Reformation Studies (IRG)</i>, the project partner and publisher of the Heinrich Bullinger Correspondence Edition. Additionally, information from other knowledge sources is available. The following overview shows the information available in the online search system:

                        The guiding standard is the HBBW Edition:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Summaries and annotations (footnotes) have been adopted 1:1 from the HBBW Edition with a few exceptions. These exceptions are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Signature details for letters with facsimiles reflect the current state at the time of facsimile creation. If these differ from the signatures printed in the HBBW Edition, they are listed as "old signatures" and can be found through search.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The notation of footnote references has been standardized in <i>Bullinger Digital</i>. In the earlier volumes, footnote references followed the system a–z, aa–zz, aaa–zzz, etc. In the later volumes (and in <i>Bullinger Digital</i>), the notation follows the system a–z, aa–az, ba–bz, etc.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Marginalia printed in Volume 1 were not included.</li>
                                    <li>Various dashes and hyphens have been standardized to a simple hyphen "-".</li>
                                    <li>
                                        In the footnotes of edited letters, references to line numbers from the HBBW Edition are sometimes found. These line numbers have not been included in <i>Bullinger Digital</i>.

                        <p>
                            The letters are primarily written in Latin (80%) and Early New High German (FNH German, 18%), often with language switching (code-switching) within the letters. A small number of letters (fewer than 10) are written in French, Greek, and Italian. These languages are also found in quotes and other inserts within Latin and FNH German. There are also a few Hebrew inserts.
                        </p>
                        Accordingly, the letters of the Latin alphabet, including historical special characters, primarily appear:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                In FNH German: In addition to today's standard umlauts (äöü), umlauts with a superscript "e" (<em class="diacritics">aͤ, oͤ, uͤ</em>) and a superscript "o" (<em class="diacritics">uͦ</em>) are present, as well as the German "ß".
                            </li>
                            <li>In Latin, there is also the "ę" (e-caudata).</li>
                            <li>
                                In French letters (and also in footnotes), French diacritics appear (à, è, é, ì, ç, …).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Letters and quotes in Greek use the Greek alphabet, including diacritics (rough breathing, smooth breathing, acute, grave, circumflex, trema, iota subscript), and many combinations thereof.
                        </p>
                        <p>Few Hebrew inserts use Hebrew characters.</p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, the HBBW Edition has used various quotation marks, all of which have been adopted in <i>Bullinger Digital</i>. The following are used: " „“ «» ‹›
