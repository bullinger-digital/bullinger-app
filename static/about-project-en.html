        <p>Bullinger Digital was a project based at the Institute of Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich from 2020–2025, with the goal of making the Bullinger correspondence available online. To this end, digitized images (scans) of the letters were commissioned from various Swiss memory institutions, existing information was collected from multiple sources, processed into machine-readable formats and consolidated, and enriched using computational linguistic methods. In particular, a system for automatic handwriting recognition was trained to convert the manuscripts of the approximately 3,500 untranscribed letters into electronic text. The letters were also automatically tagged and translated into English, using Large Language Models (LLMs). The general public was involved twice via Citizen Science campaigns: at the project launch to verify and supplement metadata, and near the end to check and add automatically recognized proper names.</p>

        <h2>Letter Collection</h2>
        <p>The currently known collection of letters comprises over 10,000 letters to and 2,000 letters from Heinrich Bullinger. The preservation of so many letters is thanks to Bullinger himself: as a pioneer of historical source research, he recognized the value of his correspondence and collected the letters. From some of his correspondents (or their widows), he was able to retrieve his letters, and he also kept drafts or copies of others. This collection of around 9,800 letters is kept in the State Archives of the Canton of Zurich (StAZH). Another 1,300 are in the Zurich Central Library (ZB), with the remaining letters spread across 91 archives and libraries in Switzerland and Europe.</p>
        <p>For Bullinger Digital, 31,187 digitized pages were assigned to 11,274 letters. Mainly autographs or originals were digitized, and in some cases copies or drafts if the sent letters were no longer available or could not be obtained. For some letters, digitized versions of different document types exist—for example, autograph and draft, copy, or enclosure.</p>
        <h2>Printed Edition</h2>
        <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.irg.uzh.ch/de/forschung/bullinger/edition-briefwechsel.html">Heinrich
                Bullinger Correspondence Edition</a> (HBBW Edition) has been affiliated with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.irg.uzh.ch/de.html"><strong>Institute for Swiss Reformation History</strong></a> at the University of Zurich since the 1970s, and was financially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) and the Protestant Reformed Church of the Canton of Zurich until the end of 2020. During that period, about 3,100 letters from 1523 to 1548 were published in print.</p>
        <p>Since August 2021, the edition has continued under a newly established private foundation, still affiliated with the <a
            target="_blank" href="https://www.irg.uzh.ch/de.html"><strong>Institute for Swiss Reformation History</strong></a>. In November 2024, another volume with nearly 100 letters from January to April 1548 was published, and the next volume is in progress. The volumes are available and searchable <a target="_blank" href="http://teoirgsed.uzh.ch/">online</a>.</p>
        <h2>Digital Edition</h2>
        <p>The trigger for the Bullinger Digital project was the end of SNF funding for the HBBW Edition and the conviction that the information already compiled by the HBBW team should be made available online, and that missing letter texts could be created using automatic handwriting recognition. This goal was achieved in May 2023.</p>
        <p>With the continuation of the printed edition, the requirements for the digital edition changed. The new goal was to also integrate future volumes of the printed edition into the digital edition. To ensure this integration and the long-term availability of the digital edition, the database and the online search system were migrated into the TEI Publisher from January 2024 to May 2025. This allows future letters prepared for the printed edition to be converted via script into TEI-XML and incorporated into Bullinger Digital. In addition to occasional metadata corrections or additions, this also means replacing the provisional texts created by the HBBW team and the machine-generated texts with rich commentary.</p>
        <p>With the end of Bullinger Digital under the direction of Prof. Dr. Martin Volk and Dr. Patricia Scheurer, the responsibility for maintaining Bullinger Digital passes to the State Archives of the Canton of Zurich, which will handle future content updates. This includes entering any corrections and adding newly edited letters from the HBBW Edition as well as any newly discovered letters to or from Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>In the second project phase, the information from the database was converted into TEI-XML and the online search system was migrated to the <a target="_blank" href="https://teipublisher.com/">TEI Publisher</a> as the central publication platform.</p>
        <p>The TEI Publisher is understood as a toolbox—a collection of reusable components and functions that can be freely combined. The entire source code of the digital letter edition is also available on GitHub for review and reuse.</p>
        <p>By using an open-source platform developed by a <a target="_blank" href="https://e-editiones.org/">larger community</a>, the long-term availability of the digital letter edition can be sustainably ensured.</p>
