        <h1>Information about the Editorial Principles</h1>
        <p>The HBBW edition is our authoritative source:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Abstracts and annotations (footnotes) were, with few exceptions,
                    adopted as-is from the HBBW edition. The exceptions are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The signature information for letters that have facsimiles
                            reflects the current state at the time of facsimile creation.
                            If these differ from the signatures printed in the HBBW edition,
                            the latter are stored as "old signature" and can be found via the search.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The notation of footnote references has been standardized in <em>Bullinger
                                Digital</em>. In the first volumes, the footnote notation followed the system a–z, aa–zz, aaa–zzz, etc. In the
                            later volumes (and in <em>Bullinger Digital</em>), the notation follows the system a–z, aa–az, ba–bz, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The notes in the page margins that were printed in HBBW volume 1 were not included in Bullinger Digital.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Different hyphens and dashes have been standardized and are shown as a simple hyphen "-".</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In the footnotes of the edited letters, there are sometimes references to line numbers from the printed HBBW edition.
                            These line numbers were not included in <em>Bullinger Digital</em>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We trained our system for automatic handwriting recognition (HTR)
                    using the HBBW edition transcriptions and the preliminary transcriptions of the
                    HBBW editorial team.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the metadata, square brackets [ ] indicate that the information was inferred
                    and not found on the letter itself. In searches, square brackets are ignored.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Letters not yet published in the HBBW edition
                    may have differing metadata. The different versions are linked to one another.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In general, it should be expected that metadata for letters from May
                    1548 onward (i.e., not yet revised by the HBBW edition) may undergo changes and
                    corrections.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2 id="sprachen-zeichensätze-und-zeichen">Languages, Character Sets and Characters </h2>
        <p>The letters are written primarily in Latin (80%) and Early New High German
            (ENHG, 19%), often with code-switching
            within the letters. A small number of letters (fewer than 10)
            are written in French, Greek, and Italian. These
            languages also appear in quotations and other insertions in Latin
            and ENHG. Additionally, there are a few Hebrew insertions.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, most letters are written in the Latin alphabet,
            including historical characters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In ENHG: In addition to the umlauts of modern German (äöü), also
                    umlauts with superscript 'e' (<em>aͤ, oͤ, uͤ</em>) and superscript 'o'
                    (<em>uͦ</em>) as well as the German 'ß' are used.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In Latin, the character 'ę' (e-caudata) is frequently used.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In French letters (and also in the footnotes), French
                    diacritics appear (à, è, é, ì, ç, …).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The letters and quotations in Greek use the Greek alphabet
            with diacritical marks (Spiritus asper, Spiritus lenis, Akut, Gravis, Zirkumflex, Trema, Iota subscriptum) and many combinations
            thereof.</p>
        <p>The few Hebrew insertions appear in Hebrew characters.</p>
        <p>The HBBW edition comes with different quotation marks over the years, which have been preserved in <em>Bullinger
                Digital</em>. These include: " „“ «» ‹›</p>
